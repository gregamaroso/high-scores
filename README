# Challenge

The goal of this repo is to process a large dataset (file based processing), finding the top-5 scores
from the results and the associated data.

# Commands

```
// To format the code. Typically this would be a pre-commit hook,
// but in this case I kept it as a separate command.
npx prettier --write .


// Learn more about the available options
npm run process help


// Run the processor with default options
npm run process


// Run the processor with non-default options
npm run process -- -c <num> -f <file>
```
